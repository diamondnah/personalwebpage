    <h1 id="heading1"> What I think of the world... </h1>
    <h2 id="h1"><u> "How was the universe created?"</um> </h1>
      <p id="smallh"> I believe the universe and everything in it was created by God. He is the creator of time - in fact He is time Himself.
        God is the beginning and the end - our time scale is not His time scale just like our plans are not always His plans.
        I believe the Creation process cannot be labelled with our timing and dating. Of course it is possible for God to have created everything in
        six days - He could have created everything in one hour! However, God's definition of "six days" may not be what we are familiar with.
        The Earth could have a long history of millions and billions of years old like many scientists say, but it could also be only thousands or ten
        thousands of years old like others say.</p>
      <p id="smallh"> There are multiple reasons as to why I do not agree with the idea of evolution and the Big Bang theory. First of all, there are
        too much evidence that shows the universe and the things that inhabit it are not made randomly - some things are too complex to have evolved over time.
        In addition, the biggest reason why I do not agree with evolution is the fact that humans have a natural sense of morality and an idea of good/bad or
        right/wrong. Those things do not evolve - they are instilled into us because we were made in the image of God. </p>

    <h2 id="h2"><u>What does it mean to be a human being? </u></h2>
    <p id="smallh2"> I believe human beings are sinful by nature, but are conscious of good and bad because we were made in the image of God. I believe the purpose
      of our existence is to bring praise and glory to God. However, because we are sinful, we do not always do that. We live for many things and idols. Our idols
      can be physical and literal like statues, food, or grades. It can also be figurative and emotional like our pride, achievements, or even failures. I believe
      our identity lies in whatever we base it upon. We can choose to identify ourselves by our relationship with God or we can choose to identify ourselves by
      materialistic things or our success and failures. </p>

    <h3 id="h3"><u>What happens when you die?</u></h3>
    <p id="smallh3"> This one is pretty controversial, but as a Christian and as I highly regard the Word of God or the Bible, I believe people either go to Heaven or Hell based
      on their faith and their relationship with God during their time on Earth. What we do and believe in our present life will affect the rest of our eternity.</p>
